# space-of-solutions-RNN

Charting and navigating the space of solutions for Recurrent Neural Networks.
This repo contains the process we used to:
1. extract graphs from the dynamics (see find_solution_types.py)
2. extract numerical features from the activity during training (see extract_training_features.py)
3. predict solution type from training features (see predict_class_from_training_features.py)

For each settings (task, architecture and number of hidden units) that we included in the paper we provided here four example networks.
More detailes can be delivered upon request.
